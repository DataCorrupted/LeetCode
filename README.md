## Status: 49/949

## Test

For early solutions there are no integrated testing. 
You have to manually fill _debug. cpp_ with test cases to debug.
These solutions include:

	[1-14].cpp
	17.cpp
	[19-29].cpp
	32.cpp
	[35-37].cpp
	[39-42].cpp
	[44-45].cpp
	48.cpp
	58.cpp
	[64-67].cpp
	[69-70].cpp
	78.cpp
	409.cpp

Others generally come 4 integrated testing. Run _./main_ will do.

To extend more tests, implement test3 with calls to your test 4, 5, ...
